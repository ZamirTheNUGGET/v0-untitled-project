        Welcome to Door County Bouncy House! We're Zamir and Zohran Overbeck. We are two brothers on a
        mission to turn ordinary gatherings into unforgettable celebrations in Door County with our bouncy
        houses.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our journey began at a birthday party when we wanted to rent a bouncy house for our own birthdays.
        The nearest company was all the way in Green Bay. That's when we had an idea: why not bring the fun
        closer to home?
      </p>
      <p>
        We started Door County Bouncy Houses so families right here in Door County could enjoy the same
        excitement and happiness we loved as kids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's a birthday bash, a community festival, or a backyard family reunion, we believe every
        kid and adult deserves a chance to laugh, jump, and make joyful memories together.
